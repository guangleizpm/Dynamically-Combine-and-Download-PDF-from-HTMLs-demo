**Beginning:**
- Offer a glossary with images for key math terms.
- Use sentence starters for explanations: “The answer is greater than…”
- Pair students to match math symbols with their meanings.

**Intermediate:**
- Provide fill-in-the-blank templates for math statements.
- Guide students to restate problems in their own words.

**Advanced:**
- Encourage students to explain their reasoning using academic language.
- Support group discussions comparing different solution methods.

**Advanced High:**
- Challenge students to create their own math problems and explain the solutions.
- Have students review and critique sample work for accuracy and clarity.
